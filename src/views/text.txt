Through this exercise, I learnt a lot about the different parts of full-stack development, from creating static websites to server implementation. This course did not completely cause me to become proficient in webdev, as I believe that such things only come from experience and a lot of time. However, I would say that this course has taught me the methods to develop my skills and what direction I can head towards. Many services and tricks I was not aware of before were made clear through this course, and it also prompted me to search for tools that could satisfy my requirements. I am interested in finding more about the best practices and developments of web development, and I hope that by improving my ability I can one day work on a project that I think is cool.
